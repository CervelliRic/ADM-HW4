## 1) Does basic house information reflect house's description?

### House description: 
House enjoys pursuing the truth, and he knows we all see the world through our own lenses. He's constantly trying to strip himself of those biases, to get a clean, objective view of things, House speaks multiple languages, he listens the jazz and plays the piano and has an interest in vintage electric guitars.

I'm sorry guys I was wrong, seriously.

In this section of HW4 we implemented two clustering .we created two datasets and each of them is filled by data that we scraped.
You can check our results in this repo.

## 2) Find the duplicates!

You can check in this repository HASHING.ipynb here there is our code about this part.
We downloaded  passwords2.txt file and we took it  as input. Each row corresponds to a string of 20 characters.We define our hash function that associates a value to each string. The goal wads to check whether there are some duplicate strings.
- in the first case order was not important. Thus, "AABA" = "AAAB".
- in the second case "AABA" != "AAAB"
